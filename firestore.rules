/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for LiFE-iN-SYNC application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user has complete control over their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-specific data is nested under /users/{userId} to ensure data isolation. A top-level /expenses
 * collection is used for simplified querying, with rules enforcing ownership via a `userProfileId` field.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private; listing all users is disallowed.
 * - All write operations require the user to be authenticated and the owner of the data.
 * - Data consistency between the `userProfileId` field and the authenticated `uid` is enforced.
